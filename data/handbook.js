        subsections: [
          {
            title: "Spinning",
            content: "Spinning rods are typically between 1.8 and 3 meters in length and vary in stiffness. Stiffness affects the ability to cast lures over long distances and control the fish. Spinning reels should be lightweight yet durable. An ideal choice is a spinning reel with a precise drag system, which makes it easier to handle larger fish."
          },
          {
            title: "Fly Fishing",
            content: "Fly rods are longer and more flexible than spinning rods. Fly fishing rods are designed for the precise casting of lightweight flies, so the balance between flexibility and accuracy is essential. Fly reels are generally simple in design and focus on durability rather than complexity."

        subsections: [
          {
            title: "Monofilament Line",
            content: "Made from a single strand of nylon, this line is versatile and affordable. It has high elasticity, which helps absorb fish strikes. Monofilament is great for beginners as it is easy to handle, but its stretch can reduce sensitivity."
          },
          {
            title: "Braided Line",
            content: "Made from interwoven fibers, braided line is incredibly strong and has little to no stretch. This makes it perfect for situations where high sensitivity is needed, such as bottom fishing or predator fishing with spinning gear. However, braided line can be more visible in clear water, requiring the use of a leader."

          {
            title: "Fluorocarbon Line",
            content: "Nearly invisible underwater, fluorocarbon is ideal for fishing in clear waters. It is highly resistant to abrasion and UV rays, which extends its lifespan. However, it is less flexible than monofilament and more expensive than braided line."

            title: "Leaders",
            content: "Leaders prevent fish from biting through the line and increase the invisibility of the setup in the water. Steel leaders are used when targeting predatory fish like pike, while fluorocarbon leaders are better for cautious fish in clear waters."

          {
            title: "Sinkers",
            content: "Sinkers stabilize the rig in the water and affect the depth at which the bait is presented. Light sinkers are used in calm conditions or shallow waters, while heavier ones are necessary for deep water or strong currents."

          {
            title: "Floats",
            content: "Floats help control the bait during fishing. They come in various shapes and weights depending on the fishing conditions. For still water, thin, elongated floats are best, while heavier floats are used for fishing in currents."

            title: "Sea Fishing",
            content: "When fishing in saltwater, it's important to choose corrosion-resistant materials like carbon fiber rods and stainless steel reels. The line should be thick and braided to withstand the strength of sea fish. Fluorocarbon leaders are recommended, as sea fish are often very cautious."
          },
          {
            title: "River Fishing",
            content: "In rivers, where the water is often murkier, you can use monofilament or braided lines. For fishing in currents, choose setups with heavy sinkers and floats to keep the bait at the right depth. River rods can be of medium length and stiffness."
          },
          {
            title: "Lake Fishing",
            content: "For lake fishing, where long casts are often needed, longer spinning rods are suitable. Fluorocarbon line may be used in clear and transparent water to reduce the visibility of the rig. Lighter floats are ideal here, as there is no current to contend with."
